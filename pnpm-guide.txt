You can resolve this by temporarily changing the execution policy to allow scripts to run. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

Open PowerShell as Administrator:

Search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu, right-click on it, and select Run as Administrator.

Check the Current Execution Policy (optional):

You can check the current policy by running this command in the PowerShell window:

Get-ExecutionPolicy


Set Execution Policy to Allow Scripts:

Run the following command to allow scripts to run temporarily:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass


This only changes the policy for the current PowerShell session, so once you close PowerShell, the setting will revert.

Run the Command Again:

Now, try running the pnpm dlx shadcn@canary init command again.

Optional - Revert Execution Policy:

If you want to revert to the default policy after running your command, simply close PowerShell. If you want to change the policy permanently, you can run:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Restricted
